MySQL wrapper for MySQLi
========================

This collection of MySQL functions is trying to be a drop in replacement for the PHP MySQL extension. In PHP 5.5 the MySQL extension is deprectated and triggers errors.
This package is trying to support legacy projects without the need of having the MySQL extension installed by using this package you are not hold back to update to new PHP versions.

The return values of my functions are aimed to match the native MySQL functions as close as possible.
